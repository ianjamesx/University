Join statements

Join statements are used to combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column
between the tables. For example, if you were to have two tables with a related column ID,
then you could join the two tables based on that related ID column. A join selects records
from both tables. There are four types of joins, inner joins, outer joins, left joins, and
right joins.

Left joins return all records from the 'left' table, and matched records from right table
Right joins return all records from 'right' table, matched records from left
Outer joins retrurn all records matched
Inner joins return all records matched in both tables
