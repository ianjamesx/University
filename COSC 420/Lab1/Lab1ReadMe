USING THE PROGRAM:

To use the program, compile using mpicc, when executing, input the number you wish
to test for primality by entering it after the ./a.out

e.g.) ./a.out 175

The program will list every two numbers (excluding the input * 1) which multiplied
results in the input

If you see no output, the input is prime

NOTE: ENSURE INPUT IS IN CORRECT ORDER

for example, the number being tested should come IMMEDIATELY after executable name

mpiexec ./a.out 127 -n 4    <-- correct
mpiexec ./a.out -n 4 127    <-- will not work

DESIGN:

The number of ops (work per node) is calculated, then ranges are set which are used to
assign all nodes an amount of operations (numbers) to handle
