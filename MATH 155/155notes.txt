NOTES FOR 155

types of samples

simple random sample - size n, chosen by method in which each sample of size n has equal chance of being selected, and is representative
random sample - sample chosen by method in which individual in population has equal chance of being selected

----

Qualitative: classify data into categories
  ordinal: has a natural order
  nominal: has no natural order


Quantitative: Numeric, how much
  discrete: variable whose possible values can be listed or counted
  continuous: variable that can assume any value on an interval

DESIGN OF EXPERIMENTS

experimental unit - individual which is studied
outcome response - what is measured of each experimental unit
treatments - procedure applied to each experimental unit

parameter - characteristic of entire population of interest
e.g. average age of employees at factory is 30

----

Graphs

stem/leaf - put first digit on left of line, other digits on right
dot plot - write values below, put dot for every instance of value

frequency distribution
Frequency distributions for quantitative data are just like those for qualitative data
except that the data are divided into classes rather than categories.

relative frequency = frequency / sum of all frequencies

The cumulative frequency of a class is the sum of the frequencies of that class and all previous classes.
cumulative relative frequency = cumulative freq. / sum al off freqs.


Frequency Polygon - get midpoints of each class (for freq. distribution), put on x-axis, frequency on y-axis
relative frequency polygon - same, except use relative frequency on y-axis

Ogive - type of polygon, eitehr frequency ogive or relative frequency ogive. 


----

Observational Study
Study wehre assignment to treatment group is not done by investigator

In a perfrect study, groups would not differ in any way except how they recieve treatement
In practice, not possible, randomization is next best thing

If large difference, can conclude likely due to treatment

Cofounding
Could be other factors influencing result

Outcome variable
what is being measured after treatement

Cohort
Group of people linked in some way

Case controlled
Study that compares subjects belonging to two different groups

Cohort study
Group of subjects to determine if factor of interest are associated with an outcome

Prospective cohort study - subjects followed over time
Cross sectional - measurements taken at one point in time
Retrospective - observational study where cases have happened before study takes place

BIAS

Example: if we draw a simple random sample for a study, may not be accruate, average many simple random samples


-------

Empirical rule
applies to bell shaped distribution
gives approx. percentage of values that fall within standard deviation from mean
68% within 1sd
95% within 2sd
99.9% within 3sd

Chevyhev's Theorom
Applies to any dataset. Gves a lower bound for percentages of values that are within a certain number of standard devs from mean
At least 75% within 2sd
At least 89% within 3sd

Coefficient of variation
CV - tells how large the standard deviation is relative to the mean (standard dev/mean)

Measures of Position
Description of relative standing of a certain data value within entire data set
The standard score (z score) represents distance value is from the mean

Percentiles - divivde dataset into 100 parts (e.g. 27% percentile)

to find percentile, (e.g. P58 for 58th percentile) compute Locator 
Compute locater L using formula L = k/100(n) (n=number of values in dataset)

If L is an integer then Pk = (Lth value + (L+1)th value) / 2
If L is not an integer then round up to the next larger integer
